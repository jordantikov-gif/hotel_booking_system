# My Project Booking System

**My Project Booking System** is a web-based application for managing online bookings.  
It allows users to browse available hotels or services, leave comments, and make reservations directly through the website.  

The project was entirely developed by me as my first full-stack web application using **PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 5**.

## 🔐 Admin Dashboard
The admin panel provides full control over the booking system:  
Administrators can view all reservations, including details such as hotel name, client name, email, phone, booking date, number of guests, price, and notes.  
Each record can be **edited** or **deleted** through the interface.
