# hotel_booking_system

The admin panel is a protected section of the system, accessible only after authentication.
I have implemented CRUD operations on the bookings table:

Create – a reservation is added from the user interface

Read – all reservations are visualized in a table form

Update – the information can be updated using the "Edit" button

Delete – the entry is removed from the database using "Delete"
