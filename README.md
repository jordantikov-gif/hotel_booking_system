# My Project Booking System

**My Project Booking System** is a web-based application for managing online bookings.  
It allows users to browse available hotels or services, leave comments, and make reservations directly through the website.  

The project was entirely developed by me as my first full-stack web application using **PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, javaScript and Bootstrap 5**.
